### Summary of student reflections

Disclaimer: This was written with help of AI.

#### 1. `distance_threshold=0` + `n_clusters=None` (5+ students)

The demo code uses these settings to build the *full* dendrogram, but students then ran `.fit_predict()` with those same settings and got 500 singleton clusters. The resulting scatter plots looked like meaningless color noise — and, crucially, looked *identical* across linkage methods.

- Several students assumed their code was broken
- One went to office hours; one concluded `single` and `ward` "are the same"

`distance_threshold` sets the stopping point for merging clusters: clusters keep getting merged together as long as they're closer than this number, and stop once they'd be farther apart than it.

#### 2. The sklearn estimator workflow: `.fit()` vs `.predict()` vs `.fit_predict()`

One student wrote:

```python
blobs_X = StandardScaler().fit_transform(blobs_X)
my_clusters_blob = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=8)
# ...then plotted, never having fit the model
```

They assumed that fitting the *scaler* had also fit the *model*.


#### 3. No criteria for *comparing* two clusterings

For Q1.c) and Q2.b), students reported the plots "looked similar upon first glance" and they "didn't know what to look for." They lack vocabulary for judging clustering output.


#### 4. Linkage criteria are being learned from AI, not from lecture

Students used ChatGPT/Claude to get step-by-step explanations of `ward` (SSE-based merging) and `single` (chaining) — and those who did wrote genuinely good explanations. That's the system working, but it suggests lecture coverage of linkage was thin relative to what the lab demanded.
